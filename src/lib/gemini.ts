          text: 'Okay, here\'s a breakdown of how to limit your prompts and API usage to stay within your free tier limits (15 RPM and 1500 requests per day), specifically regarding generating course outlines:\n\n**Understanding the Limits**\n\n*   **RPM (Requests Per Minute):** You can make a maximum of 15 API calls within any given minute.  Exceeding this will result in rate limiting (your requests being rejected).\n*   **Daily Limit:** You have a total of 1500 requests available each day.\n\n**Key Considerations for Limiting Prompts**\n\n1.  **Chapter Generation is Expensive:** Generating even *one* detailed chapter outline can easily consume several API requests, especially if you\'re asking for descriptions, topics, and video links within each chapter. Generating 200 chapters is almost certainly *way* over your RPM *and* daily limit.\n\n2.  **Focus on Efficiency:**  Structure your prompt to get the most information with the fewest API calls.  Batch related requests whenever possible.\n\n3.  **Plan for Error Handling:** Include error handling in your code to gracefully deal with rate limits and other potential issues.  This is crucial for providing a good user experience even within the free tier.\n\n**Specific Prompt Limits and Strategies**\n\nHere\'s what you should limit and how to do it, with code examples:\n\n*   **a.  Limit the Number of Chapters:**  This is the MOST important thing to control.  Don\'t let users request an unlimited number of chapters.\n    *   **Example:** Set a maximum allowable chapter count in your UI/code.\n\n    ```python\n    MAX_CHAPTERS = 10  # Example: Limit to 10 chapters\n\n    def generate_outline(user_requested_chapters):\n      num_chapters = min(user_requested_chapters, MAX_CHAPTERS)\n      print(f"Generating outline for {num_chapters} chapters (max allowed: {MAX_CHAPTERS})")\n      # ... your API call logic here ...\n    ```\n\n*   **b.  Limit the Level of Detail:** Requesting a simpler outline consumes fewer tokens and potentially fewer API calls.\n\n    *   **Example:**  Offer different outline levels (e.g., "Basic", "Detailed", "Very Detailed") and adjust the prompt accordingly.  A "Basic" outline might just have the chapter title and a one-sentence description.  A "Detailed" outline could include topic lists and video link suggestions.  The "Very Detailed" outline is what we have been using.\n\n    ```python\n    def generate_prompt(topic, num_chapters, detail_level="Basic"):\n      if detail_level == "Basic":\n        prompt = f"Generate a course outline for {topic} with {num_chapters} chapters. Just provide the chapter title and a one-sentence description for each."\n      elif detail_level == "Detailed":\n        prompt = f"Generate a course outline for {topic} with {num_chapters} chapters. Provide the chapter title, a longer detailed description, and a list of 3-5 relevant topics for each chapter."\n      elif detail_level == "Very Detailed":\n                prompt = f"Generate a detailed course outline in JSON format based on the following specifications:\\nCategory: [Programming]\\nTopic: [{topic}]\\nAdditional Description: [Learn Python from scratch to become a ML Engineer]\\nDifficulty Level: [Beginner]\\nTotal Duration: [More than 3 hours]\\nInclude Videos: [yes]\\nNumber of Chapters: [{num_chapters}]"\n\n      return prompt\n    ```\n\n*   **c.  Implement Rate Limiting (Even with the Input Limits):** This is a safety net in case of unexpected code behavior or user input errors.  Many libraries exist to help with this.\n    *   **Example (using `time.sleep` - basic):**\n\n    ```python\n    import time\n\n    REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 15\n    SLEEP_TIME = 60 / REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE #Sleep time in seconds\n    api_call_count = 0\n    last_minute_start = time.time()\n\n\n    def make_api_call(prompt): #Replace this with your actual api call function\n        global api_call_count, last_minute_start\n        current_time = time.time()\n\n        if current_time - last_minute_start >= 60: #Check how long since last minute\n            api_call_count = 0\n            last_minute_start = current_time\n\n        if api_call_count >= REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE:\n            sleep_duration = 60 - (current_time - last_minute_start)  #Seconds until the next minute\n            print(f"Rate limit reached. Sleeping for {sleep_duration:.2f} seconds...")\n            time.sleep(sleep_duration) #Sleep until the next minute resets\n            api_call_count = 0\n            last_minute_start = time.time()\n\n\n        time.sleep(SLEEP_TIME)\n        api_call_count += 1\n\n        # REPLACE THIS with your actual API call\n        print(f"Making API call: {prompt}")  # Simulate API call\n        return f"Response for: {prompt}"\n    ```\n\n*   **d. Implement a queue:** Instead of generating the full course immediately, you could add sections to a queue. The queue is processed in the background, respecting your RPM. This provides a smoother user experience as they don\'t have to wait for everything immediately. This requires more complex coding.\n\n**Putting it all together (Conceptual Example):**\n\n1.  **UI:** The user selects a topic and the number of chapters (limited to, say, 10). They also select the detail level ("Basic", "Detailed").\n2.  **Code:**\n    *   Your code uses the selected options to generate a prompt (using the `generate_prompt` function example above).\n    *   You then use `make_api_call` (or your actual API call function, wrapped with rate limiting) to get the chapter outline.\n    *   Handle the API response, parse the JSON, and display the results to the user.\n3.  **Error Handling:**  If the API returns an error (e.g., rate limit exceeded), display a friendly message to the user, explaining that they need to wait before generating more content.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n*   **Prioritize limiting the number of chapters.** It\'s the biggest resource hog.\n*   **Implement rate limiting in your code** (using `time.sleep` or a more robust library).\n*   **Offer different detail levels** to give users some control over API usage.\n*   **Handle errors gracefully** and provide informative messages to the user.\n\nBy carefully controlling these factors, you can effectively use the free tier and avoid overloading your API. Remember to test your code thoroughly with different settings to ensure that you stay within your limits. Good luck!\n',
